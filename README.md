This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## React/Redux Todo Application

# Alias - Todos/Goals

Todos/Goals is a React/Redux application that allows a user to create a checklist of both todos; which can be added, toggled and removed, and long term goals; which can be added and removed.

In a bid to understand the inner workings of Redux, this project aims to rebuild the basic functionalities of the Redux library from scratch. Progress of this can be viewed in the different branches where:

  1. The basic functionalities of Redux's store are recreated, including:
      - Ability to get the state
      - Ability to listen to changes on the state.
      - Ability to update the state.
  2. A Vanilla JS & HTML UI is created to interact with this store.
  3. The UI is swapped with a React JS UI.
  4. Calls to the store are updated to be asyncronous.
  5. The project folder structure is revamped to meet industry standards.
